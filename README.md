# Usage
If you haven't already, extract your ISO for SONIC THE HEDGEHOG using the [Sonic '06 Toolkit](https://github.com/HyperBE32/Marathon/releases)

To install Legacy of Solaris onto your copy of SONIC THE HEDGEHOG, you will need the [Sonic '06 Mod Manager](https://github.com/Knuxfan24/Sonic-06-Mod-Manager). Click `Code` and `Download ZIP` then put the Legacy of Solaris folder (**NOT** the `LoS-Mod_Files_X-master` folder) from the downloaded archive into your mods directory. Then check the mod in the Sonic '06 Mod Manager's mod list and click `Save, install content and launch Sonic '06`.

### PS3 Version Announcements

- The PS3 version has been cancelled, do not ask about a PS3 version, it's not going to happen. 

### DISCLAIMER

99% of mods will NOT work in tandem with LoS.

### Other languages

Do to popular demand I have added complete support for the spanish language. Now all of the unique text is in spanish. (This was done via machine translation so if you notice anything odd and would like to correct the main offenders (in game hints, and loading screen hints) please feel free to contact me!
I am looking for anyone willing to translate this mod into japanese and potentially the other languages it supports, german, and french.
If you have the time are willing, by all means feel free to contribute.

### The game is crashing!!/things are not working

I am not going to take any reports of the mod making the game crash if you are using other patches beyond what LoS already uses by default. I am not responsible for testing the comptability of every patch with the LoS mod. Do not report anything like t posing, not being able to switch from elise to sonic in kdv ex, etc. if you are using a different player arc.
It is a user created problem, not something that is the fault of the mod itself.
