This repository holds the Xbox 360 version of Legacy of Solaris. 

# Usage
If you haven't already, extract your ISO for SONIC THE HEDGEHOG using the [Sonic '06 Toolkit](https://github.com/HyperBE32/Marathon/releases)

To install Legacy of Solaris onto your copy of SONIC THE HEDGEHOG, you will need the [Sonic '06 Mod Manager](https://github.com/Knuxfan24/Sonic-06-Mod-Manager). Click `Code` and `Download ZIP` then put the Legacy of Solaris folder (**NOT** the `LoS-Mod_Files_X-master` folder) from the downloaded archive into your mods directory. Then check the mod in the Sonic '06 Mod Manager's mod list and click `Save, install content and launch Sonic '06`.

If you have any other questions please watch this tutorial on how to install Legacy of Solaris

### PS3 Version Announcements

- The PS3 version has been cancelled, do not ask about a PS3 version, it's not going to happen. 

### DISCLAIMER

99% of mods will NOT work in tandem with LoS.

### Other languages

Do to popular demand I have added complete support for the spanish language. Now all of the unique text is in spanish. (This was done via machine translation so if you notice anything odd and would like to correct the main offenders (in game hints, and loading screen hints) please feel free to contact me!
I am looking for anyone willing to translate this mod into japanese and potentially the other languages it supports, german, and french.
If you have the time are willing, by all means feel free to contribute.

### The game is crashing!!/things are not working

I am not going to take any reports of the mod making the game crash if you are using other patches beyond what LoS already uses by default. I am not responsible for testing the comptability of every patch with the LoS mod. Do not report anything like t posing, not being able to switch from elise to sonic in kdv ex, etc. if you are using a different player arc.
It is a user created problem, not something that is the fault of the mod itself.

### Notes for installation:
Legacy of Solaris now requires Gordon Ramsay's Complete Physics Overhaul, Physics Companion, and Khronos mods. The mod will not function properly without them. Please follow all instructions for their installation, including installing the Khronos Resources.,
Legacy of Solaris MUST be loaded last in the mod managers priority. If your priority is set to "bottom to top", then LoS must be at the top of the list. If "top to bottom", then at the bottom of the list.,

### Known issues
Multiplayer no longer works with Legacy of Solaris, as it will not load with Physics. This will most likely not be fixed.,
Some stages are still in need of additional polishing, but every stage is beatable.,
Mephiles is missing a few particles. Will look into this.,
Spanish and French language support for the post-game quest as Sonic is not implemented as of yet, as we're waiting on the translations.,
